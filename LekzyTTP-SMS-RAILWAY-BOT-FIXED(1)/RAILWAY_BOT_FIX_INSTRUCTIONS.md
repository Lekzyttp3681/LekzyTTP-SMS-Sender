# 🔧 RAILWAY TELEGRAM BOT FIX INSTRUCTIONS

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
Railway is only running the **web** process (SMS app) but not the **bot** worker process. Your bot is receiving messages but can't respond because the bot worker isn't running.

## ✅ **SOLUTION - Enable Bot Worker Process:**

### **METHOD 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. **Go to Railway Dashboard** → Your Project
2. **Click "Settings"** tab
3. **Look for "Services" or "Processes"** section
4. **You should see:**
   - `web` (✅ enabled) - SMS app
   - `bot` (❌ disabled) - Telegram bot
5. **Enable the "bot" service**
6. **Click "Deploy"**

### **METHOD 2: Upload Fixed Package**
If you don't see the bot service option:

1. **Download the fixed package** from this repo
2. **Upload to Railway** (will create both services)
3. **Enable bot worker** in settings

## 📋 **Environment Variables Required:**
Make sure these are set in Railway Variables:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7356697443:AAFHPL6u1Riyun6qn_A5ubFjjgm8dxaaA1E
TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID=1241344415
SECRET_KEY=lekzy-ttp-production-secret-2025
ADMIN_PASSWORD=LekzyTTP@3681
DEFAULT_API_KEY=lekzy-ttp-default-2025
```

## 🔍 **How to Verify Bot is Working:**
After enabling bot worker:

1. **Check Railway Logs** - Should show:
   - Web process: Gunicorn SMS app logs
   - Bot process: "Starting Lekzy-TTP Telegram Bot on Railway..."

2. **Test Bot Commands:**
   - Search `@ttpsmsenderbot` on Telegram
   - Send `/start` - Should get admin welcome message
   - Send `/listkeys` - Should show your API keys

## 📱 **Expected Bot Response:**
```

## 🚨 **Key Point:**
Your bot IS receiving messages (I can see them in the API logs), but Railway needs TWO separate processes:
- **Web process**: Runs your SMS app
- **Bot worker**: Runs your Telegram bot

Enable the bot worker and your bot will start responding immediately!
